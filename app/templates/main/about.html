        <p class="lead fs-5">URL Shortener is an amazing tool. You can shorten your long urls to enhance your
            productivity.</p>
        <p class="lead fs-5">Simply go to homepage and enter your long url in 'URL' field.If you wish to use custom back-half URL, 
            simply enter your custom back-half string in 'custom back-half' field. 
            However this is an optional step. 
            If you wish, you can leave 'custom back-half' field empty. 
            Then URL Shortener will automatically generate a short URL consisting of upper-case and lower-case letters and numbers. 
            Length of automatically generated URL will be on first come first serve basis. 
            The URL shortened first will have small length short URL than late ones.</p>
